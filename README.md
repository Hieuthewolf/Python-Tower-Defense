## Motivation
I've always wanted to create a tower defense game since I've drawn inspiration from games like Bloons Tower Defense and Warcraft 3 tower defense game maps. Furthermore, I wanted to practice more with object orientated programming and this game provided a great opportunity to create different classes for objects such as towers, enemies, menus, etc.
